                <h2>Students learn how to critically evaluate website quality, learn how to create and maintain quality web pages, learn about web design standards and why they're important, and learn to create and manipulate images. The course progresses from introductory work on web design to a culminating project in which students design and develop websites for local community organizations.</h2>

                <h2 className='m-2 font-bold text-xl'>*** Course Structure</h2>
                <p>The curriculum begins by establishing a foundation of design theory principles that are revisited regularly throughout the course. Students apply these principles in building a rubric by which all of their web design projects are measured. Once this foundation is established, the curriculum teaches the basics of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), emphasizing document structure and content. Only after a document's structure and content are in place do students manipulate the appearance of the content using Cascading Styles Sheets (CSS) and images. Unit 4 provides a variety of basic skills in graphic design, and subsequent units explore site management, server-side and client-side scripting, and effective use of web authoring tools. The final unit outlines a culminating project in which students are partnered with local community organizations to design and develop websites on their behalf.</p>

                    Learning is the source of human progress.

                    It has the power to transform our world
                    from illness to health,
                    from poverty to prosperity,
                    from conflict to peace.

                    It has the power to transform our lives
                    for ourselves,
                    for our families,
                    for our communities.

                    No matter who we are or where we are,
                    learning empowers us to change and grow
                    and redefine what’s possible.
                    That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege.

                    And that’s why Coursera is here.
                    We partner with the best institutions
                    to bring the best learning
                    to every corner of the world.

                    So that anyone, anywhere has the power to
                    transform their life through learning.</h2>
